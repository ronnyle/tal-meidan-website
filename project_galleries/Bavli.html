title: Bavli Project (2021)- 3 bdr apartment TLV
path: /images/projects/Bavli/
description: |
    This project was a collaboration with my studio’s lead interior designer, Noa Bar, and it serves as a case study in the importance of smart planning and prioritization. The family purchased a modest 700-square-foot apartment for themselves, their two daughters, and their dog.
    During our second meeting at the studio, as we always do, we asked them to create a "dream list" for the home and rank their priorities. Amazingly, we were able to fulfill every wish—from creating space to host 20 people for dinner, to carving out a private "stargazing" corner in the parents' small suite under a green window, to finding clever storage solutions and designing flexible, modular spaces that provide privacy when needed.
    The process was filled with excitement, unexpected life events, and a deep sense of gratitude. The end result is exhilarating, as there’s nothing quite like seeing an apartment fully realize its potential.
