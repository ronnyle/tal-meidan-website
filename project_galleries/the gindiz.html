title: The Gindiz (2020) 3 bdr apartment in TLV

description: |
    This project was a collaboration with my studioâ€™s lead interior designer, Noa Bar. The clients were an international couple with a unique zest for life, who eventually became my neighbors. In fact, when I was contemplating how dark the windows in our restrooms should be, I called the client and asked her to describe in detail what she sees of me! ðŸ˜Š
    It was truly a designerâ€™s dream. They were the most stylish clients, fully trusting our vision, and together we breathed life into this chic apartment in a Tel Aviv tower. No idea was off the table; we had the freedom to explore any concept that came to mind, and the enthusiasm was infectious.
    We made some bold decisions, such as swapping out walls for internal windows and installing a striking electrical bar display with lights hanging from the ceiling. The living room features a statement wall adorned with golden wallpaper, and we opted to forgo a traditional dining table in favor of a high table and chairs for everyday gatherings. For hosting, a long modular table opens up to accommodate ten people.
    Recognizing the couple's high stimulation threshold, we chose a rich color palette and implemented a monoblock style in the coupleâ€™s suite, using deep, sensual blue for the carpentry and walls.
    We love everything about this projectâ€”itâ€™s a true reflection of the clientsâ€™ vibrant personalities and our creative collaboration.
