    When Anat first called to discuss the project, she admitted that while she recognized the talent in my work, she didnâ€™t quite connect with my style. Despite that, she wanted me on board because she felt we were a good personal match. And what can I say? She was right.
    Through a long, sometimes challenging journey filled with bureaucratic hurdles, we embarked on an adventure together. Along the way, we found common ground both aesthetically and spiritually. The result is a bright, carefully curated home that reflects our shared vision. I ensured the foundation remained neutral, while vibrant pops of color come from dynamic, interchangeable elements. These details can be rearranged daily, giving the family the flexibility to adapt the space to their comfort and mood.
