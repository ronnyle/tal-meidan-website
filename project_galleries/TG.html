    This couple, who have a permanent place in my heart, were the first to experience my "speedy course," which has since become a studio favorite. Everything you see here was completed in just three days—shopping, planning, flea market trips, assembling, and mounting! Because of the wall texture, which is common in the U.S. but not in Tel Aviv, I recommended skipping wallpaper in favor of a special painting technique. This not only added character but also cleverly concealed the plaster casts that lowered the ceiling in parts of the living room.
    Thanks to the project’s success, I formally published it, and it has since become one of our studio’s best sellers.
