    This project was a collaboration with my studio’s lead interior designer, Noa Bar.
    How often does a designer get a client who asks for their home to resemble Alice's Wonderland? We were incredibly lucky to embark on this wild journey where "no" wasn’t in our vocabulary, but "more!" was heard frequently. Tami inherited this compact apartment from her beloved grandmother, and along with it, we salvaged some beautiful vintage pieces that needed a little love—and we had plenty to give. The apartment underwent a full 180-degree transformation, including the addition of a closed balcony. The result? A space that is vibrant, exciting, and full of life—like stepping through the looking glass into a whimsical, enchanting world, exactly like Alice in Wonderland, only better - this is Tami’s wonderland!
