    We took the house after seeing a 3 minutes video. This house may not be our dream home, but its excellent location and spaciousness for our four children made it a worthwhile choice before our move from Israel to California.
    Walking in for the first time was a shock; the space felt closed, outdated and uninviting. However, I quickly shifted my perspective, realizing I could create a vibrant and character-filled home within weeks. I owe the first years of my studio’s success to budget constraints of my first clients, leading me to embrace second-hand finds and vintage pieces.
    With the house featuring five types of flooring from various renovations and patchwork, I initially focused on finding rugs to unify the space. While I couldn’t paint the walls, I transformed the designated living room into a cozy dining area, enhancing our family gatherings.
    To tackle the outdated kitchen, I designed a large pantry from IKEA, optimizing storage and maintaining a pleasing appearance. The kids' rooms posed a challenge, but I upgraded their beds, repurposed closet space into shelves, and kept their familiar decor to ensure a smooth transition.
    Ultimately, I created a warm, inviting home that reflects our family's personality while embracing the unique charm of our new environment.
