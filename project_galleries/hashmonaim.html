title: Our Home 2021 – 6-Bedroom Apartment in Tel Aviv
path: /images/projects/hashmonaim/
description: |
    This project was brought to life through my studio, in collaboration with my close colleague, friend, and studio’s lead interior designer, Noa Bar.
    We once believed this house would be our final destination, turns out it was not. But other than that, functionally and aesthetically speaking, it has truly exceeded those expectations. It stands as a testament to the power of a clear vision, guiding every detail from concept to completion. Every inch of this space has been thoughtfully crafted over the years—some details carried over from previous homes, but most having existed in my mind for a long time.
    The design reflects my deep passion for vintage pieces, non-trivial combinations, and curated collections that tell a story. Each element contributes to a timeless aesthetic that defies trends, creating a space where history and modernity harmoniously coexist.
    I had the honor of working alongside my trusted team in Israel to transform these dreams into reality, and what we created is nothing short of our forever dream home.
