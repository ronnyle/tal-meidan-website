    This project was designed in my studio in collaboration with my forever partner in crime, Tays Goldenberg, co-founder of Timeless magazine and a fellow designer.
    This was one of my first exposures to the American design industry. While the project took place in Tel Aviv, the client had a strong connection to the USA and was able to bring a container of goods at low cost. For me, it was an exciting opportunity to explore a whole new design world filled with endless possibilities. It was during this project that I established tight connections with some of the most renowned American brands.
    We managed to temper our enthusiasm by insisting on combining local products, timeless vintage pieces, and original art. I believe that no matter how prestigious the furniture, an all-new collection can result in a flat, characterless outcome that lacks soul. Fortunately, the client was well-connected in the local art scene, allowing us to source some truly special pieces and exclusive collections.
    A wonderful starting point was the diner-style chairs the client had carried from home to home over the past two decades. These chairs significantly influenced the overall design and color palette of the space.
    Ultimately, this project became a beautiful blend of personal history and modern design, showcasing the unique character that arises when the past meets the present.
