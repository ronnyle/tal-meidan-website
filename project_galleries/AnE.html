    This project was truly one of a kind—just like something out of a Netflix show! A young man reached out, admitting right off the bat that neither he nor his wife had any sense of aesthetic taste or design skills. They were frustrated with the look of their apartment, which still resembled a bachelor’s pad despite them having lived there since their college days.
    To top it off, his wife was about to leave for a week-long business trip, and he had a bold idea: to completely redesign their home as a surprise for when she returned. What followed was nothing short of a covert operation. With a tight budget, we leaned heavily on second-hand finds, all of which he had to stash in his parents’ basement to avoid suspicion during his “sneaky” trips out.
    While she was away, I brought in the team, and we worked around the clock to transform the apartment—right up until the last minute when he rushed to the airport to pick her up. It was an exhilarating project, full of creativity, teamwork, and plenty of thrills!
