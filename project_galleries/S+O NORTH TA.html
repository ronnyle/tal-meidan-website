description: |
    This project was designed in collaboration with my colleague, Anat Steg. What I particularly admire about this house, beyond the obvious—like the lush green views from every window, natural light, and high ceilings—is its timelessness. Even seven years after these photos were taken, I still find myself appreciating the design. Since I moved to the U.S., the family has relocated to a new home, and Anat helped them with that project as well. Many of our carefully curated pieces, including the wallpaper, made the move with them, maintaining the continuity of our vision.
