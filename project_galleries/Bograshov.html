description: |
    This modern beachside home has always felt like a hidden gem to me, much like a surprise egg, as it’s tucked within a very old and neglected building. The moment you step inside, you’re immediately struck by the large Belgian windows that frame a towering tree, which sets the tone for the entire communal area. The tree’s presence even influenced the choice of the color palette, bringing the outdoors in.
    The house is filled with vibrant colors, thoughtfully applied to create a lively yet balanced atmosphere. I also wasn’t afraid to combine a variety of wood types, which work harmoniously together to enhance the warmth and texture of the space. The overall design blends old and new, warmth and modernity, style and practicality.
