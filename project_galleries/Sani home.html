    It’s quite rare for me to enter a home for design services and feel at a loss for ideas. That’s what happened to me here, but luckily soon enough I snapped out of it. This house presented unique challenges: poorly constructed with crooked walls and low ceilings, its odd layout stemmed from questionable design decisions. However, these flaws also contributed to its attractive price, allowing it to comfortably accommodate a family in their desired neighborhood.
    Once I connected with the clients on a personal level, I was determined to infuse their unique DNA and desires into the design. Through clever use of colors and optical illusions, we successfully minimized the home’s inherent shortcomings. Due to budget constraints, we couldn’t invest in brand new cabinetry, so we opted for different covers for the cupboards, breaking up the stark whites and warming up the home’s natural tones.
    To this day, this house proudly retains every element of our design, demonstrating the enduring appeal of timeless, trendless aesthetics.
