    This project was quite the journey! The couple had been following my studio for a while, and as soon as they purchased this house, they reached out to us. Fun fact: they were actually debating between this home and another one in Bavli, Tel Aviv, and in an unexpected twist, we ended up designing both homes for two entirely different, unrelated clients!
    Early in the project, we encountered an exciting opportunity when Israel’s leading paint brand approached us for a collaboration, which set the tone for a vibrant and colorful design. With a baby on the way, we created a charming, unisex nursery, and instead of dedicating an entire room to a home office, we placed a stylish workstation at the end of the corridor, complete with a gorgeous floral wallpaper.
    The kitchen became a true chef’s dream, as the couple loves to cook, bake, and entertain. When we couldn’t find the perfect artwork for their living room, I surprised them with a large painting I created just for them, adding a personal touch to the space.
