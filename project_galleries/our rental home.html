    After a long search for a spacious place in central Tel Aviv, we found a big apartment in terrible condition but with rare features like a private parking spot, four bedrooms, and a huge balcony. I proposed to the landlord that we renovate it together, and once he agreed, I immediately got to work. Little did he know, he had landed on a mine of gold. As an interior designer, I finally had the chance to apply all the ideas I had admired in my previous projects—this time for my own home. Each room was designed uniquely to reflect our family, from the colorful kids' rooms to our calm, romantic master suite. I especially loved transforming our bedroom from an uninviting space into something dreamy and warm. Despite challenges like the awkward bathroom layout, we’ve created an eclectic and cozy family space full of personality, with lots of flea market finds and a few IKEA hacks. For me, the beauty of our home is that there were no strict rules—just combining what felt right.
